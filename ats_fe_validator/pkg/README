This is a plugin of ATS (Apache Traffic Server).

Should mimic media_fe_validator used to do - http://dist.corp.yahoo.com/by-package/media_fe_validator/

On receiving  request -
-----------------------------
Should do the following only in CARP mode (check if CARP header set by ATS carp
plugin is present)
1) Strip 'Accept-Encoding' header before forwarding request to Origin Server
2) Make sure request type is only GET or HEAD. For other request types like
POST, intercept the call and send back a 400 ( Not sure if we still need this ?)

On receiving FE response
-----------------------------
Should do the following if response has not already been processed by another
FEV plugin (check response header set by FEV plugin is not present) -
1) Check response status code, content type and response body (more details of
the checks can be found here -
http://svn.corp.yahoo.com/view/yahoo/media/common/lib/fe_validator/trunk/src/MediaFeValidator.php?revision=1561183&view=markup#211)
     a) if invalid - take action (like change status code to 500, make
     Cache-Control header as private, add X-Response-Code header, send back
     empty body etc)
          b) if valid  - let the response pass through

To use this plugin, install this package

For debugging, you can use
$ /home/y/bin/traffic_server -T fe_validator
which will show you debugging output for each request.
